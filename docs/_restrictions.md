Restrictions & Caveats {#restrictions}
======================
In addition to those listed for some functions.

## Troubleshooting the LCK-file
1. A broken LCK-file can cause sync issues, including appearance of
  wrong/inconsistent data for readers. When database opened in the
  cooperative read-write mode the LCK-file requires to be mapped to
  memory in read-write access. In this case it is always possible for
  stray/malfunctioned application could writes thru pointers to
  silently corrupt the LCK-file.

  Unfortunately, there is no any portable way to prevent such
  corruption, since the LCK-file is updated concurrently by
  multiple processes in a lock-free manner and any locking is
  unwise due to a large overhead.

  The "next" version of libmdbx (MithrilDB) will solve this issue.

  \note Workaround: Just make all programs using the database close it;
              the LCK-file is always reset on first open.

2. Stale reader transactions left behind by an aborted program cause
  further writes to grow the database quickly, and stale locks can
  block further operation.
  MDBX checks for stale readers while opening environment and before
  growth the database. But in some cases, this may not be enough.

  \note Workaround: Check for stale readers periodically, using the
              `mdbx_reader_check()` function or the mdbx_stat tool.

3. Stale writers will be cleared automatically by MDBX on supported
  platforms. But this is platform-specific, especially of
  implementation of shared POSIX-mutexes and support for robust
  mutexes. For instance there are no known issues on Linux, OSX,
  Windows and FreeBSD.

  \note Workaround: Otherwise just make all programs using the database
              close it; the LCK-file is always reset on first open
              of the environment.


## Remote filesystems
Do not use MDBX databases on remote filesystems, even between processes
on the same host. This breaks file locks on some platforms, possibly
memory map sync, and certainly sync between programs on different hosts.

On the other hand, MDBX support the exclusive database operation over
a network, and cooperative read-only access to the database placed on
a read-only network shares.


## Child processes
Do not use opened `MDBX_env` instance(s) in a child processes after `fork()`.
It would be insane to call fork() and any MDBX-functions simultaneously
from multiple threads. The best way is to prevent the presence of open
MDBX-instances during `fork()`.

The `MDBX_ENV_CHECKPID` build-time option, which is ON by default on
non-Windows platforms (i.e. where `fork()` is available), enables PID
checking at a few critical points. But this does not give any guarantees,
but only allows you to detect such errors a little sooner. Depending on
the platform, you should expect an application crash and/or database
corruption in such cases.

On the other hand, MDBX allow calling `mdbx_close_env()` in such cases to
release resources, but no more and in general this is a wrong way.

## Read-only mode
There is no pure read-only mode in a normal explicitly way, since
readers need write access to LCK-file to be ones visible for writer.

So MDBX always tries to open/create LCK-file for read-write, but switches
to without-LCK mode on appropriate errors (`EROFS`, `EACCESS`, `EPERM`)
if the read-only mode was requested by the `MDBX_RDONLY` flag which is
described below.

The "next" version of libmdbx (MithrilDB) will solve this issue for the "many
readers without writer" case.


## One thread - One transaction
  A thread can only use one transaction at a time, plus any nested
  read-write transactions in the non-writemap mode. Each transaction
  belongs to one thread. The `MDBX_NOTLS` flag changes this for read-only
  transactions. See below.

  Do not start more than one transaction for a one thread. If you think
  about this, it's really strange to do something with two data snapshots
  at once, which may be different. MDBX checks and preventing this by
  returning corresponding error code (`MDBX_TXN_OVERLAPPING`, `MDBX_BAD_RSLOT`,
  `MDBX_BUSY`) unless you using `MDBX_NOTLS` option on the environment.
  Nonetheless, with the `MDBX_NOTLS` option, you must know exactly what you
  are doing, otherwise you will get deadlocks or reading an alien data.


## Do not open twice
Do not have open an MDBX database twice in the same process at the same
time. By default MDBX prevent this in most cases by tracking databases
opening and return `MDBX_BUSY` if anyone LCK-file is already open.

The reason for this is that when the "Open file description" locks (aka
OFD-locks) are not available, MDBX uses POSIX locks on files, and these
locks have issues if one process opens a file multiple times. If a single
process opens the same environment multiple times, closing it once will
remove all the locks held on it, and the other instances will be
vulnerable to corruption from other processes.

For compatibility with LMDB which allows multi-opening, MDBX can be
configured at runtime by `mdbx_setup_debug(MDBX_DBG_LEGACY_MULTIOPEN, ...)`
prior to calling other MDBX functions. In this way MDBX will track
databases opening, detect multi-opening cases and then recover POSIX file
locks as necessary. However, lock recovery can cause unexpected pauses,
such as when another process opened the database in exclusive mode before
the lock was restored - we have to wait until such a process releases the
database, and so on.


## Long-lived read transactions
Avoid long-lived read transactions, especially in the scenarios with a
high rate of write transactions. Long-lived read transactions prevents
recycling pages retired/freed by newer write transactions, thus the
database can grow quickly.

Understanding the problem of long-lived read transactions requires some
explanation, but can be difficult for quick perception. So is is
reasonable to simplify this as follows:
  1. Garbage collection problem exists in all databases one way or
     another, e.g. VACUUM in PostgreSQL. But in MDBX it's even more
     discernible because of high transaction rate and intentional
     internals simplification in favor of performance.

  2. MDBX employs Multiversion concurrency control on the Copy-on-Write
     basis, that allows multiple readers runs in parallel with a write
     transaction without blocking. An each write transaction needs free
     pages to put the changed data, that pages will be placed in the new
     b-tree snapshot at commit. MDBX efficiently recycling pages from
     previous created unused snapshots, BUT this is impossible if anyone
     a read transaction use such snapshot.

  3. Thus massive altering of data during a parallel long read operation
     will increase the process's work set and may exhaust entire free
     database space.

A good example of long readers is a hot backup to the slow destination
or debugging of a client application while retaining an active read
transaction. LMDB this results in `MDB_MAP_FULL` error and subsequent write
performance degradation.

MDBX mostly solve "long-lived" readers issue by the lack-of-space callback
which allow to aborts long readers, and by the `MDBX_LIFORECLAIM` mode which
addresses subsequent performance degradation.
The "next" version of libmdbx (MithrilDB) will completely solve this.

- Avoid suspending a process with active transactions. These would then be
  "long-lived" as above.

  The "next" version of libmdbx (MithrilDB) will solve this issue.

- Avoid aborting a process with an active read-only transaction in scenarios
  with high rate of write transactions. The transaction becomes "long-lived"
  as above until a check for stale readers is performed or the LCK-file is
  reset, since the process may not remove it from the lockfile. This does
  not apply to write transactions if the system clears stale writers, see
  above.


## Space reservation
An MDBX database configuration will often reserve considerable unused
memory address space and maybe file size for future growth. This does
not use actual memory or disk space, but users may need to understand
the difference so they won't be scared off.
